# Phospholipase A1 Structural and Phylogenetic Analysis

This repository contains the files, code, and data for my BB485 final project.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed structural conservation analysis and phylogenetic inference for phospholipase A1 (PLA1) across a diverse set of Hymenoptera and related insects.

- **Structural conservation** was analyzed using AlphaFold models, ConSurf, and ChimeraX.
- **Phylogenetic inference** was performed using multiple sequence alignment (MAFFT) and maximum likelihood tree inference (RAxML).

## Repository Contents

- `data/` : All raw input data, including AlphaFold PDB files, ConSurf outputs, and sequence files.
- `results/` : Final generated figures and analysis outputs.
- `panel.py` : Python script to generate the structural conservation panel figure.
- `fig_gen.py` : Python script to generate the phylogenetic tree.

## Software Used

- Python (Biopython, matplotlib, Pillow)
- MAFFT
- RAxML
- ConSurf Server
- UCSF ChimeraX
